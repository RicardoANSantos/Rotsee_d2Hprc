## Scripts and Files

- **monte_carlo_d2Hprc.R**: Performs Monte Carlo simulations for vegetation-corrected δ2Hprc reconstruction using an n-alkane relative abundance (R.A) index and hydrogen fractionation factors. Computes 68% and 95% confidence intervals, generates LOESS-smoothed plots.
- **monte_carlo_d2H_residuals.R**: Performs Monte Carlo simulations to compute δ2Hprc residuals after temperature and ice volume/sea level corrections. Builds on outputs from `monte_carlo_d2Hprc.R`.
- **compare_records_non-detrendeds.R**: Compares FI.M6 with other records using correlation metrics (raw, cross-, running), with interpolation, smoothing, and even-grid resampling (non-detrended version).
- **compare_records_detrended.R**: Similar to `compare_records.R` but with linear detrending to focus on variability.
- **Inputs_d2Hprc_comparison.xlsx**: Input file for `compare_records_non-detrendeds.R` and `compare_records_detrended.R` (BP and value columns for FI.M6 and other records).
- **ROT21_Inputs_MonteCarlo_simulation_d2Hprc_veg.corr_Temp.xlsx**: Input file for reconstruction/residuals scripts (Age_BP_ka, d2H_C29, f_GR estimators on different sheets).
- **ebio.R**: Calculates biosynthetic hydrogen isotope fractionation (ε_bio) for n-C29 leaf-wax in modern European plants by comparing measured n-C29 δ2H to modelled leaf-water δ2H.
- **ROT21_Inputs_ebio.xlsx**: Input file for `ebio.R`.
- **RH_Sensitivity_tests.R**: Forward-models leaf-water hydrogen isotope enrichment (Δ2HLW) using a Craig–Gordon + Péclet approach under multiple climate scenarios (RH-only, Temperature-only, and RH–T covary).

## Usage

### General Setup:
- Ensure R and packages are installed.
- Place input files in your working directory or update paths in scripts.
- Run scripts via `source("script_name.R")` in R.

### Run `monte_carlo_d2Hprc.R`:
- Adjust f_GR variable (e.g., R.A_fGR sheet) if needed.
- Outputs raw simulations, summarized CIs with LOESS, and plots.
- Uses 10,000 iterations; set.seed(12345) for reproducibility.

### Run `monte_carlo_d2H_residuals.R`:
- Uses outputs from the reconstruction script (e.g., means/CIs as input).
- Applies temperature/ice corrections; outputs residuals with CIs.

### Run `compare_records.R` or `compare_records_detrended.R`:
- Set input_file to the comparison Excel.
- Generates per-record plots and summary TXT.
- Optional: Uncomment print plots or modify records_list for custom methods.

### Run `ebio.R`:
- Place `ROT21_Inputs_ebio.xlsx` in the working directory (or update `input_file` in the script).
- Script automatically:
  - filters to woody PFTs (TC, SE, SC, TD, SD),  
  - calculates ε_bio (n-C29 vs modelled leaf water) and ε_app (n-C29 vs precipitation),  
  - derives 68% and 90% confidence intervals from leaf-water percentiles,  
  - propagates analytical uncertainty of n-C29.  
- Generates per-sample CSV output, a PFT-level ε_bio figure, and text summaries for woody PFTs and woody plant type (WP).

### Run `RH_Sensitivity_tests.R`:
- No external input files required; uses built-in modern climate parameters.
- Simulates Δ2HLW across: RH-only (60–90%); Temperature-only (10–16 °C); RH–Temperature covarying scenarios
- Outputs a high-resolution figure exploring how RH, temperature, and vegetation structure influence leaf-water hydrogen isotope enrichment.
- Useful for interpreting δ2H plant-wax records, evaluating sensitivity tests, and contextualizing YD–Holocene transitions.

## Notes
- **Input Data**: Contact the corresponding author (r.n.santos@unibas.ch) for supporting information or full datasets.
- **Reproducibility**: Scripts use set.seed() for consistent results.
- **References**: Fractionation values from Central Europe; sea level from Lambeck et al. (2014); temperature coefficient from manuscript. See scripts' headers for caveats (e.g., normal distributions, linear assumptions).
- **Customization**: Adjust parameters (e.g., n_simulations=10000, LOESS span=0.2, grid_res=200) for other datasets.
